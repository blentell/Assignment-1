1. What is a javascript function? 
A javascript function is the basic building block of code that is used for a pre-designed purpose.  Each function can perform a single purpose or multiple purposes, such as calculations or outputting lines of text.

2. What is a callback?
A callback is a reference inside of a function to a previous function that is passed as an argument and later invoked within the later function.

3. can callbacks only be used in asynchronous code?
No callbacks can also be synchronous. Meaning they block additional functions from executing until they have completed their execution.

4. Why are javascript functions first-class citizens?
Functions in javascript act as First Class Functions, aka they can treat functions as values, can pass a function as an argument and can return a function from another function(Higher Order Functions).

5. Explain javascript Closures?
Javascript Closures are a combination of the contained function and its lexical environment (state). 

6. explain try/catch blocks
Try blocks are blocks of code designated for trying to execute and catch blocks are what tells javascript what to do if the try block is unsuccessful.
